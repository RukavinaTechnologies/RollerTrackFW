## Overview
This guide will walk you through the process of updating the firmware on your RollerTrack device using the RT Firmware Updater tool.

## Prerequisites
- A Windows PC
- Your RollerTrack device
- A USB cable to connect the RollerTrack to your PC
- The RT Firmware Updater tool ("RT Firmware Updater.exe")

## Steps to Update Firmware
1. **Connect the RollerTrack to Your PC**
   - Use a USB cable to plug your RollerTrack device into an available USB port on your PC.

2. **Run the RT Firmware Updater**
   - Open the "RT Firmware Updater.exe" program.

3. **Verify the COM Port**
   - The updater will display the available COM ports.
   - Ensure the selected COM port corresponds to your RollerTrack device (it is likely the only available port).
   - If no port is detected, check your USB connection and click "Refresh" to scan again.

4. **Confirm the Detected Firmware**
   - The tool will display the detected firmware file.
   - Ensure that it matches the firmware file included in the update package.
   - If no firmware is detected or if you downloaded the firmware file separately, you can select the option to use custom firmware and browse to the downloaded file location.

5. **Flash the Firmware**
   - Click the "Flash Firmware" button.
   - Follow any on-screen prompts to complete the update process.

6. **Completion**
   - Once the update is finished, the tool will confirm the successful flashing of the firmware.
   - You can now disconnect and use your updated RollerTrack device.

## Troubleshooting
- If your device is not detected, ensure it is properly connected and try a different USB port.
- Restart your PC and try again if the updater does not recognize the device.
- Contact customer support if you encounter any persistent issues.
